An infinite runner in HaXeFlixel

==========

Originally designed as a tutorial on how to make an infinite runner using HaXeFlixel, this project grew
beyond it's original scope. It was used as an entry in the first every Procedural Death Jam put on by
OpenGameArt.org on 16 March 2014. Special thanks to my wife and 3-year-old son for play testing the hell
out of it and laughing the whole time.
